## Project 2

We used parameters to automate the creation of 6 reports summarizing and analyzing popular news source data. We created numeric as well as graphical summaries displaying the amount of times different news articles were shared and the relationship between shares and other variables.
Then, we created multiple linear models as well as ensemble models to try and see how all other news variables impact the amount of article shares. We also automated a comparison of these models in order to select the one with the best fit.
The parameter for automation was the 6 different data channels for which the articles could appear. Thus, we created a report for each data channel summarizing shares data and fitting a model to predict the amount of shares based on other variables.

## Reflection

If I could do anything differently, it would be using my time more wisely as I had a lot going on in other classes and work, but I still feel as if I could have started earlier or set aside more time to dedicate to the project.
The most difficult part for me was figuring out what variables to use in the models as there was so many that it simply wasn't feasible to use all of them for complexity reasons. We used correlation measures to determine this.
My big takeaways from this project is now having a better understanding of the automation of reports as well as uploading and collaboriting on a project through GitHub. Before, I struggled with these concepts, but now I can now understand the process.
