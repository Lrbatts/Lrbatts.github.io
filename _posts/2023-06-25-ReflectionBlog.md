## Process

I chose to use the Pokemon API to extract and manipulate data from the Pokemon universe. I grew up loving Pokemon so this project definitely intrigued me. I used processes from our notes including the httr and jsonlite packages to read in the data within a funciton in order to be able to subset it to different endpoints of different data depedning on what the user specified. I then used a number of numeric and graphical summaries of the data to get interesting summaries of some of the endpoints. I found it interesting to see what type of Pokemon was most common(water) and seeing all the heights and weights of how they were designed.

## Struggles

I found it difficult learning how to take the original dataframe in which endpoint columns with data frame as the variable type and turning that into a usable dataframe for each endpoint. It took a lot of guessing and checking as well as tweaking of code but eventually I figured it out through researching functions such as unnest_wider. If I were to do it differently, I would have done more research into the API itself in order to truly understand what I was reading in to potentially help speed up the process.
