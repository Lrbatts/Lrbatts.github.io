Data Science vs. Statistics

Data science is a growing industry destined to have an impact on the world along with statistics. The two fields are similar, yet distinct in specific processes they use and need to be used together t provide useful insight to what exists within data.
To me, being a data scientist is about taking a dataset and exploring, manipulating, and evaluating it to bring about insight. Their role is to extract data and clean it in orde r for it to be interpreted and analyzed. they must have knowledge in machine learning and have a basis in applied statistics to be able to interpret results.
Statistics is similar in that you are dealing with data but is different in that statisticians are more interested in finding values of uncertainty and concepts such as p-values or confidence intervals. 
Many data science properties and statistical in nature, but follow a distinct data science process that can be more approachable. In the end, the two fields work together to accomplish a similar goal.
Data scientists need an understanding in applied statistics to be able to interpret results and statisticians need an understanding in the model and structure of the data in order to be able to analyze.
While the two fields are distinct in their processes, the two come together in the end for a similar result: interpreting data and collecting insight. 
After researching the differences in these fields, I view myself as more of a statistician an heart with an eagerness to learn data science. I come from a statistics major and so naturally that aspect appeals to me. 
I now realize how the two fields work together and would like to pursue data science in order to truly enhance my knowledge and be able to understand data.
