## Thoughts on R

Coming into this course, I would say I have intermediate experience in R and SAS with some experience in Python as well. Personally, I would say R is my favorite language as there is so many ways to go about accomplishing a task and it is very user friendly. For any function, it is easy to seek help within RStudio as far as arguments and actual outputs of the function. Because of this, as far as programming languages go, I consider R one of the difficult languages to know. Although coding itself was brand new to me when I first learned R, I feel as if I was able to catch on rather quickly. SAS was also a good language as far as readability of the code.
